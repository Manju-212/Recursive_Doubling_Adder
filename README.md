# Recursive_Doubling_Adder
Recursive Doubling Adder  64 bit

For Cin = 0 give Cin as kill i.e , Cin = 2'b00 \n For Cin = 1 give Cin as generate i.e, Cin = 2'b11

In the given files if you want to generate Verilog code for particular no of bits just run that python code and Enter the no of bits you want and the adder file will be generated.
